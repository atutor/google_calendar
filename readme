Google Calendar ReadMe


This module allows users on an ATutor system to integrate their personal Google Calendar into the ATutor environment. Details to setup your calendar are presented in the main page pages of the module once installed (mods/google_calendar/index.php).

Calendars can be shared or private. In most cases users will want to keep their canlendar private, in which case they will need to copy the approriate URLs to their private calendar, and save those values into ATutor. 

It is possible create a shared calendar, but not via this module. It is intended to allow users to integrate their personal calendars into ATutor. If you wish to create a shared calendar that can be accessed, and used at various levels by class members, you can copy the HTML like that below (generated on the Calendar Details screen) into an ATutor content page, replacing the email address with the one associated with the shared calendar and setting the timezome, to create a shared course calendar for your courses.  See the Google Calendar Help page for additional details on setting up shared calendars.
